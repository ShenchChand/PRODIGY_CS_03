# The password strength assessment tool evaluates passwords based on:

   Length: Provides varying scores and feedback for different ranges of password length.
   Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: Checks for the presence of both and provides guidance if missing.
   Digits: Evaluates if the password contains numbers.
   Special Characters: Ensures the inclusion of symbols like !@#$%^&*.
   Common Patterns: Flags passwords using weak or predictable patterns (e.g., 123456 or password).
   Sequential/Repetitive Characters: Penalizes predictable sequences

## example

### Enter your password: P@ssw0rd123
output: 
Password Strength: Moderate (Score: 6/10)
Feedback:
- Good length (12-15 characters).
- Has both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Includes numbers.
- Includes special characters.
- Avoid common patterns or weak passwords like '123456' or 'password'.
